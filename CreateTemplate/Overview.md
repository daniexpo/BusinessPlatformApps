# Overview <a name="Overview"></a>

The solution template framework allows you to quickly and easily create your own templates or applications. 
These templates can provision multiple components including Azure Services such as Logic Apps, Azure Functions 
or Azure SQL, third party SaaS services such as Scribe and Informatica, or utilize on-premises (on-prem) applications and services 
such as SQL Server, Task Scheduler or Simplement. The framework is split into five components. 

## UI Wizard (Pages) 
In order to provision a template, a template will usually require critical information from the user such as credentials 
to third party applications (like twitter or Salesforce) or customizations for the template. 
The UI layer is made up a list of pages which are designed to guide the user through a wizard like experience to collect and validate the information they enter. This information will be used to help provision resources by either collecting credentials, server information or choosing customizations for the template being deployed. 

## Deployment Actions (Actions)
An action is simply a task which is executed. An action can serve two purposes; 
*	either it performs a validation such as checking for credentials or 
*	provisioning a resource such as Azure SQL or Azure Functions. 
Once a user has reached the final page in the wizard, they will be shown a list of actions which when executed in order provision 
successfully an End-to-End instantiation of the solution. 

## Data Store
The data store is effectively a vault which stores all the session information. The datastore is passed across the UI pages 
and actions. All actions usually depend on information stored inside the vault i.e. the get databases action will require the 
database name and server information be inside the datastore to succeed. The UI will usually collect these details from the user 
and insert them into the data store but actions can also insert data into the data store. An example of an action is the Azure login 
action which inserts the azure token directly into the data store for subsequent actions to use. 

## Manifest file(init.json)
The glue which holds the templates together is a JSON file which defines which pages should be rendered and which actions should be 
executed on the final page. There is a lot of functionality available inside the JSON file which we will covered later such as adding 
items into the datastore, executing actions on next or on validate, and setting javascript variables.

Today, the framework has a list of Pages and Actions which can be shared and reused between templates without any coding required. 
We have samples available which can guide you through adding features, UI pages, actions, or even customizing an existing page. 
They require minimal coding, and it is super easy to integrate into a new template. The great news is we are adding to this list and the team is constantly listening for feedback on which ones we should prioritize next. 


# Setting up your machine <a name="devbuild"></a>
Prerequisites

* Visual Studio 2017 or later
* Microsoft .NET Core 1.0.1 or later
* Git
* Node.js
* GitHub account

Setup

1.	Clone the BPST repository (Team Explorer → Connect)
*	This step might pop up with an authentication dialog; in case it does, open this page
*	Click “Generate New Token”
*	Check all the boxes and then click “Generate Token”
*	The Visual Studio dialog will probably have both a username and password field; paste the token inside the username field and leave the password field blank
2.	Open the Microsoft.Deployment.sln (Accessible by clicking the button that looks like a House in Team Explorer)
3.	Wait for the packages to finish restoring (the first time you open the solution this can take 1-2 minutes)
4.	Build the solution (be warned that if you Clean or Rebuild, it will try to grab the latest nuget packages, which will add 1-2 minutes)


# Tutorials <a name="tutorials"></a>
All the tutorials are saved in the Source/Apps/SampleApps location. In order to create a new App, your App folder must contain a file called init.json, this registers the app during build and deployment. Before getting started, make sure you can sucessfully build the project and ensure when you run the project you are shown the following snippet:

to run a tutorial or navigate to a template, First debug the web project (found inside DeploymentAppService solution), then Navigate to localhost:1503/?name=Tutorial1. the name parameter defines which solution template you wish to load

## Tutorial 1 <a name="tutorial1"></a>
To create a new template create an init.json file underneat a folder name. Be sure to choose a unique foldername, as the template name is based on the folder name. 

Copy and paste the following text in the contents of the init.json

```json
{
  "Install": {
    "Pages": [
      {
        "name": "$SiteCommon$/pagesgallery/getting-started.html",
        "displayname": "Getting Started"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


Lets break down the init.json. the ```Install``` tag tells the framework
that we are describing the process for the installation flow. the other supported  flow is uninstall

Next comes ```Pages``` the pages tag is an array of all the pages you wish to show to the user. a page
is usually designed to collect information from the user such as credentials or customizations. the pages themselves are 
made from HTML and Typescript. The ```name``` tag defines the path of the page. in general, alot of the pages are available for you to consume from the pages gallery.
The list of pages in the pages gallery is always growing and can be found in Source/SiteCommon/Web/PagesGallery. in this case the $SiteCommon$ refers to the SiteCommon/Web folder.


Finally the ```displayname``` tag is used to define the freindly name that appears in the navigation menu when you navigate to the website.

Debug the Web project and you should be shown the website below load

![HomePageNoTemplate](./Images/HomePageNoTemplate.PNG)

Navigate to Tutorial 1 (http://localhost:1503/?name=Tutorial1)
You will now be shown a window which  loads a default getting started page.
![HomePageTutorial1](./Images/HomePageTutorial1.PNG)

You have now sucessfully created your first template.
